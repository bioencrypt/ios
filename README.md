# Welcome to BioEncrypt
BioEncrypt balances mobile application security with usability. TrustScores are generated from over 30 behavioral biometric and device integrity data-points to determine an authentication method proportionate to the risk. Trust Measurements normalize security posture across devices and users enabling consistent enforcement of security in diverse environments. 

 - Prevents decryption when a high risk device or user exceeds the threshold
 - Chooses a secure authentication form dynamically
 - Transparently authenticates users when the device and user are trusted
 - Cryptographically “locks in” trusted states

# How it Works

## User TrustFactors

User TrustFactors profile user access to identify the probability of physical attack, theft, or abuse. Probability of device theft/loss due to the user environment.

## Device TrustFactors

Device TrustFactors  identify unsafe data access environments resulting from platform or app issues. Probability of data breach due to system or app integrity violation.

## Tokenization
TrustFactors operate exclusively on tokenized data, preserving the uniqueness of a data point without requiring its true value. 
 - Enables cryptographic integration that “locks” the trusted state
 - Attackers cannot identify what is required to decrypt the data
 - No personal/private data is stored or processed
 - Analysis and data are 100% local to device and never removed
 
 ## Patented & Cryptographically Secure Transparent Authentication (USPTO US9477825B1 & US9992023B2)
BioEncrypt dynamically generates encryption keys from TrustFactors when the TrustScore exceeds the defined threshold.
 - Combination of high-entropy factors create a cryptographically secure solution
 - Encryption keys are combined with device TrustFactors to “lock-in” secure states
 - Authentication can be cryptographically invalidated if the device becomes high-risk

 ## Policy Execution
BioEncrypt operates using a single policy. This policy can be default or customized. All policies are automatically updated. 
A single policy supports BioEncrypt:

Customization
 - TrustFactors are classified by user, device, and category (WiFi, motion, location, etc)
 - Shared, asynchronous datasets collection maximizes performance across large numbers of TrustFactors
 - Currently 30+ TrustFactors
 - Decay metrics modulate learning speed and accuracy
 - TrustFactor can be enable/disable
 - Weights and thresholds are modifiable
 - Modify risk thresholds for user/device
 - Turn TrustFactors on or off
 - Increase/decrease associated penalties
